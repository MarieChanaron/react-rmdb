## What I practiced while doing this project

* CSS grids
* React Router
* React hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback
* Fetch data from an API (use JavaScript promises)
* PropTypes
* Styled components
* React form
* Map through an array returned by the API and add each element of the array in the JSX
* Use conditionals in the JSX
* Store data in the session storage
* Display a spinner when the browser is loading data
* Learn how to structure a React app with the principle of "separation of concerns": 
    - Separate container components from presentational components
    - Use callback functions to fetch the data
